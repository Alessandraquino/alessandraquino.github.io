<center><h1>Artist Statement <br><i><p></h1>
<p>I wanted to create poems about love because I never really talk about the good aspects of my life. Throughout my teen years, I always wrote poems that correlated to my life and the people in my life during those years. I indulge in so much heartache and emotions that I put into my artwork so I wanted to create something outside of what I do. I wanted to involve the reality of my experiences with love like with my partner, my animals, my family, and my cultural background.</p></center>
